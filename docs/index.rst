Annotation Control List Plugin 3.0
==================================

A simple, annotation-based ACL System for CakePHP

Background
----------

For the `CakePHP book <http://josediazgonzalez.com/cakephp-book/>`__ I wrote, I thought it would make sense to showcase to users how they might come up with an alternative to the ACL system that comes with CakePHP. As annotations are an interesting way of adding attributes to actions - and it's relatively easy to modify during application development - I decided that a method to do so via annotations would be the way to go.

Requirements
------------

* PHP 5.6+
* CakePHP 3.2+
